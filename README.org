* About
This project at the moment is essentially a set of goals at this point rather than a software product.
* Goals
The goals of this project are as follows in order of importance:
1. Provide the following services that can be self-hosted or loaded onto a server of choice:
   - A free/libre student information system (SIS) that could be used on a school system server.
   - A free/libre content management system to send content to students
   - A free/libre assessment creation system
2. Create a system for detailed analysis of student scores
   - This system would use valid statistical methods to analyze data in the most informative manner
   - Ideally, the system would implement machine learning on assessments created in the system to analyze student data in order to weigh questions by difficulty and offer suggestions for student improvement.
* Why?
- These systems are vital to the operations of modern schools and currently there are only propriety/paid services most of these services.
- With closed-source development of these services, it is difficult for community members to create extensions, bug-fixes, and improvements.
- School districts could customize their setup and tailor it to their needs.
- A free/libre system could be expanded upon and used in schools worldwide.
- School systems could self-host the software on their own servers or choose a web service provider of their own choosing.
* Development Plan
Here is a diagram of the proposed structure of what I wish to accomplish generally:
